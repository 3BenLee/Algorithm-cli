# Create-Algo

Create-Algo is a cli used to generate a boilerplate for solving coding challenges.

## Installation

**npm**

```bash
npm install @frootloops/create-algo
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn add @frootloops/create-algo
```

## Usage

It's nice to keep all of the coding challenges you solve in one directory. I recommend that users create a directory and repository. Give it any name you like. Then install `create-algo` in this directory as a dependency. When you want to create a new boilerplate inside of your directory to solve a challenge simply run the `create-algo` command from your desired location inside your directory. You will then be prompted to chose and Javascript or Typescript and whether or not to initialize git. Simply choose using the arrow keys and press enter. Your boilerplate will be installed in the directory and you are ready to hack on!
